# Project 2

Content Aware Image Resizing based on "Seam Carving for Content-Aware Image Resizing" by Avidan and Shamir. More details [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving)

Supported operations are:
* Decrease/increase width by a number of pixels
* Decrease/increase height by a number of pixels
* Amplify content with a specified factor
* Remove selected rectangular object

For better understanding, the script can plot the chosen seam at each step.
